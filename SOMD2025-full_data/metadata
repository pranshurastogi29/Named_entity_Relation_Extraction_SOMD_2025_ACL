Description: Lists entities annotated in the training texts, IOB format
Fields: entity_id, text_id, entity_type, start_pos, end_pos

Train Relations File (train_relations.txt)
Format: TXT
Description: Details the relations between entities within the training texts.
Fields: relation_type, entity1 token index, entity2 token index separated by '\t'. Multiple relations are separated by ';'

Test Texts File (test_texts.txt)
